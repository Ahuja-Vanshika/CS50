# **CS50 Repository**

Welcome to my **CS50** repository! This repository contains all the projects and problem sets I have completed as part of Harvard University's **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science** course.

This course has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, and problem-solving skills. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including **C programming, Python, web development, data structures, algorithms**, and much more.
