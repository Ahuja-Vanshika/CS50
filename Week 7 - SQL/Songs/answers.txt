These steps are going to be followed to characterize a listener’s audio aura depending on the listener’s top 100 songs
from the year 2018 through the mean energy, valence, and danceability:

* Data Extraction: Extract from songs.db attributes that are relevant (energy, valence, danceability).
* Averaging: Compute mean values of energy, valence and danceability of these 100songs.
* Categorization: Use these average values to illustrate the most outstanding moods of the listener.

Hypothesis on Representation Reasons why this may not be very representative:

* Music preference can alter over time and by individual Taste fluctuates width season,
mean not capturing the changes in mood or state might also affect the type of music listened to
(e.g., gym or afternoon nap) and hence the average values tend to mask such idiolect within these figures.

Proposed improvements Weighted averages:

* Let's think about weighting these features according to how often songs are listened to.
A song that is played more often needs to have larger impact on the genres.
Temporal analysis: It could be beneficial if we split our study into shorter time spans such as months or quarters
in order to catch up with different music tastes that occur over a period.
Thus it will be able to show changing patterns or feelings during seasons.
